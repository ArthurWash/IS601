= Exercise 7

For this exercise you are going to be creating a new view that returns a JSON
object with some information from your database. It is up to you to decided
how to serve the results of a query. If you finish early and want to expand
on this, you can also create another view that serves a template which utilizes
a jQuery AJAX request to retrieve and use the first view that you made.

For this exercise, submit a screen shot of _one_ of the views you created
running in a web browser.
