* Has aliases for most BASH (Linux) commands
* Needs to be run as admin to use some Hyper-V things
* Both slashes are supported, but it prefers DOS style: C:\Users\rxt1077
* Prompt starts with 'PS' and ends with '>'

== Command Prompt

* Older, uses DOS

* Uses zsh (Linux)
* Uses the backslash: `/Users/rxt1077`
* `~` refers to your home directory
* can use `sudo` to execute as root

== What is a path?

* An absolute path references something from the root of the file system:
  `C:\Users\rxt1077\IS601\README.md`
* A relative path references something from where you _currently_ are:
  `README.md` or `./README.md`
* PATH is also an environment variable that makes executables in certain
  directories available by just their relative path.
* `$Env:Path` in PowerShell (Windows) or `echo $PATH` in zsh (Mac)
